"""The stability fixes to verify-browser that no other check owns.

Each block pins one defect that shipped: a retry that turned a flaky run into a clean pass,
a resolved credential echoed in what a step expected, reset tokens kept in the request
ledger, a headed launch on a machine with no screen, a fake player that could never pass a
cleanup, one artifact budget per retry, and a dead browser worker resumed by replaying its
writes.
