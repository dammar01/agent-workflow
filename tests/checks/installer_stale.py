"""`install.py --apply` leaves no stale code behind, and never takes the user's files with it.

A release that renames or drops a skill, command, hook or provider agent used to leave the
old file installed forever, and a settings.json hook kept calling a script nobody shipped.
These checks pin the removal rule: only a file an install recorded writing, still exactly
as written, in a managed family, and no longer shipped — backed up, receipted, and undone
by --rollback. Plus the two neighbours of that rule: a dist/ that does not match its
manifest is refused, and an upgrade repoints a workspace at the build running it.
