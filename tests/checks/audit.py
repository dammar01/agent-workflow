"""The governance trail can be read back, and says what it does not cover.

Written alongside the reader itself, because a stream with no reader had no way to fail:
`audit.jsonl` was appended to on every delegated call for a whole release and nothing
ever opened it. A missing reader is invisible in a way a broken one is not.

The assertions below care about two things a summary can get quietly wrong. It must not
launder a null provider into whichever provider ran most, and it must not turn an empty
trail into a clean bill of health — an audit that reports 0 problems over 0 rows is the
same output as one that reviewed a hundred calls and found nothing.
