"""Per-node graph verification, on a graph built by hand.

A real `graphify-out/graph.json` is not available to a test — graphify is an external CLI
— so the fixture is a minimal graph in the shape the real one uses: absolute
`source_file`, `source_location` as `L<n>`, `community`, and edges tagged with graphify's
own confidence vocabulary.

What matters here is the distinction whole-graph staleness could never draw. Editing one
file must not condemn the nodes in every other file, and a line that MOVED must not be
reported as a line that changed — the first is an index that needs updating, the second is
a claim that may have stopped being true.
