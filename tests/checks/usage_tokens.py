"""Provider-reported token counts, asserted where getting it wrong stays invisible.

Every check here is aimed at one mistake: treating a breakdown as an addend. Reasoning is
reported INSIDE the output count and cached input INSIDE the input count, so any layer
that helpfully sums the fields it finds produces a bill that grows the harder a model
thinks about the same answer. That failure is silent — the number still looks like a
number — which is why it is asserted at every layer that could introduce it rather than
once at the top.

The second theme is absence. A provider that reports nothing must leave a row estimated
rather than zeroed, because a zero reads as a measurement and averages into the report as
one.
