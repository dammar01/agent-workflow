"""The five workflow contracts, and the usage stream they feed.

Two things are worth proving here and they are not the same thing. The first is that the
dataclasses round-trip — cheap, and the reason `from_dict` can be trusted at a version
boundary. The second is that `usage_from_result` DERIVES the right things, which is where
a telemetry bug would actually live: a metric that is quietly wrong reads exactly like a
metric that is right, and nothing downstream can tell the difference.

So the derivation assertions are deliberately about the distinctions that would be
invisible if broken: `accepted=None` versus `accepted=False`, an absent duration versus a
zero one, and a reuse hit being recorded at all.
