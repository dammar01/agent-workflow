"""One bounded continuation when a reply stops short of its contract.

The failure this covers is not a dead call and not a refusal: the second agent reads
everything it was asked to read, runs out of room, and hands back a work-state summary
that ends in "continue if you have next steps". The work happened; the contract was
never emitted. Failing there discards a completed read and sends the user off to gather
evidence that already exists in a live session.
