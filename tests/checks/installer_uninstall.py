"""The install stays additive at both ends: written as one block, removed as one block.

A first install used to write the whole shipped CLAUDE.md, header included, and nothing
could later tell that header from the user's own text. Uninstall had no entry point at all.
These checks pin the block-only first write, the uninstall cut that keeps the user's text
around it, the settings strip that keeps the user's hooks, and the install-time drop of a
shipped hook from an event the release no longer registers it on.
