"""The runtime imports nothing it does not ship with.

This is the check that replaces a lockfile rather than the check that postpones one.
"No third-party dependencies" is what makes a missing requirements.txt correct instead
of careless — but it was only ever an observation someone made once, and a single
`import requests` added in good faith would have quietly converted this repo into one
that needs pinning, with nothing to say so. A constraints file listing nothing would
document the claim without testing it.

Scope is the shipped runtime. tests/ may import whatever it likes: a test dependency
does not travel to a user's machine, and pretending otherwise would just push real test
tooling out of reach for no gain.
