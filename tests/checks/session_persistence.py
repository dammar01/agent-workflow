"""A provider thread id, once handed over, is kept — or its loss is named.

codex and agy report their thread id mid-stream, after the work has started, through a
callback whose failure the adapters swallow so the run survives. The write behind that
callback could fail on Windows whenever any reader held the session file open, and the
executor then believed the id was saved: `update_provider_session_id` sets it on the dict
before writing, so the post-run save skipped the one id that needed it. The thread was
lost without a word, and the next call or recovery started from nothing.

Now: a held file is outlasted by a bounded retry, storage that cannot be written fails
the call before the provider runs, a write that still fails mid-run is retried after it,
and a loss that survives both is named on the result. Every delegated result also says
what its provider was kept from (`provider_boundary`), and an agy result warns it can write.
