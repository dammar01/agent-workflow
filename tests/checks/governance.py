"""Provider allowlist, budget ceiling, tool policy, and where metadata is allowed to live.

Each control is asserted at the layer that actually enforces it, not at the layer that
describes it. The allowlist is checked through `Router.route()` because refusing at the
route is the only place a refusal still means "no call was made"; the budget is checked
through `Executor.execute()` because a ceiling that only holds when called directly holds
nowhere.

The tool policy is asserted as a DECLARATION, which is what it is. Its assertions are
about the invariant this repo can actually keep — no write tool ever appears — and not
about sandboxing, which belongs to the provider's own permission config.
