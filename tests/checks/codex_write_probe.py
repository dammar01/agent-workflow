"""codex's `--sandbox read-only` stops writes — proven against the real CLI, not its --help.

The read side of codex's boundary was probed and found open (codex reads through a shell
the permission map never sees; see adapters/providers/codex_adapter.py). The write side
rested on `codex exec --help` alone, and codex's Windows sandbox has broken between
releases before (CASE-015). Doctor and every delegated result call codex `sandboxed` for
writes (config/providers.py `boundary`); this is the check that the label is still true.

Opt-in: runs only with WORKFLOW_CODEX_PROBE=1, because it is a real, billed, authenticated
codex call. Skips cleanly when the CLI is not on PATH. The second agent is asked outright
to create two files — one through a shell command, one through its own file-edit tool —
in a throwaway project; the probe passes only if neither exists afterwards.
