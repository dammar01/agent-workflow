"""Claude transcript parsing, asserted on the distinctions that would be invisible if broken.

The schema belongs to a vendor and is not documented here, so the fixture is the contract:
every record shape in `tests/fixtures/claude/session-basic.jsonl` was copied from a real
transcript, including the torn final line a live writer can leave behind.

The checks are aimed at the judgement calls rather than the arithmetic. A parser that
counts tool results as user turns still returns a number, and the number still looks like
a measurement — it just answers "how many tools did the model call" while claiming to
answer "how many times did a person have to ask".
