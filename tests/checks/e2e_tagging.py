"""Tagging proven elements: what may be written back to a template, and what may not.

The boundary under test is narrow on purpose. A run may add `data-e2e` to a line the draft
itself cited, in a template file, inside the project, that Git carries — and to nothing
else. Everything here is a way that boundary can be crossed.
