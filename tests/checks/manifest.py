"""`dist/manifest.json` must describe the dist/ tree that ships.

CI ran `gen_manifest --check` and the local suite did not, so a manifest left stale by an
in-repo edit to dist/ stayed green on the maintainer's machine and only failed after push.
This runs the tool's real entry point, the same way the stamp_version check does: a check
that reimplements the hashing would prove its own copy.
