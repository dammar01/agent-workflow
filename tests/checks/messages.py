"""User-facing text must not carry internal accessor syntax.

Written after a real escape: the v3.4.3 split of main.py rewrote `run` -> `_main().run`
with a word-boundary regex, and the regex could not tell code from prose. Four
`next_action` messages shipped telling the user to run ``opencode _main().run``. Every
one of the 87 e2e checks, 30 simulated flows and 211 unit assertions passed — none of
them reads the words, only the behaviour.

`next_action` is the line a user follows when something has already gone wrong, so it is
the worst possible place for a leaked expression. This scan is deliberately narrow: it
looks for accessor syntax that has no business inside a sentence, not for style.
