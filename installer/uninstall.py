"""`install.py --uninstall`: take out what the workflow installed, leave what the user wrote.

An install is additive: CLAUDE.md and every provider AGENTS.md get one marker-delimited
block, settings.json gets hook entries and a statusLine, and skills/commands/hooks/agents
are files the installer recorded writing. Uninstall reverses exactly that much:

- the managed block is cut out of each instruction file; a file left with nothing else in
  it is removed, a file with the user's own text keeps that text;
- a managed file goes only when its content is still what an install wrote (the ledger or a
  receipt says so); an edited one is kept and named;
- settings.json loses the commands that run a shipped (or retired) workflow script and a
  workflow statusLine. Every other key stays, including ones an older release seeded
  (`model`, plugins): nothing records whether the user has come to rely on them.

Everything goes through the same backup + receipt an install uses, so `--rollback` undoes an
uninstall. Dry run unless `--apply`.
