"""Files an older install wrote that this release no longer ships.

`--apply` used to only add and overwrite. A skill, command, hook, or provider agent that a
release renamed or dropped stayed in ~/.claude forever, still loaded, still describing a
workflow that no longer exists — and a settings.json hook entry kept calling a script
nobody ships.

What counts as ours is decided by evidence, never by directory: ~/.claude/skills also
holds the user's own skills. A file is a removal candidate only when
  1. an earlier install recorded writing it (the ledger below, or any install receipt), AND
  2. its key sits in a family this installer manages file-by-file (skills, commands, hooks,
     provider agents), AND
  3. this release does not ship it, AND
  4. its content is still byte-for-byte what an install wrote.
A file that fails (4) was edited by the user after we wrote it: it is kept, and named.
Every removal is backed up and receipted, so `--rollback` restores it.
