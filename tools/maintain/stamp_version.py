"""Stamp the shipped docs with the one version number the code actually uses.

`config.settings.TOOL_VERSION` is the single source. Everything else — README headings,
the CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md banners, the skill files that quote a version back at the user —
is a copy, and copies drift. v3.4.2 shipped with thirteen places still saying v3.4.1,
including the `/.help` output a new teammate reads first.

Only versions on anchored lines are touched. A bare semver anywhere else is left alone:
`utils/path_guard.py` legitimately says "removed in v3.4.1", and a changelog written for
a past release must keep saying what it said.
