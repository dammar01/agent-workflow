"""The git queries the promote flow needs, in one place.

Three call sites already shell out to git independently — core/graph/graph_meta.py
(`rev-parse HEAD`), core/evidence/quick_verify.py (`_git_lines`), and
core/audit/diagnostics.py (`git_run`). This module deliberately does NOT absorb them
yet: rewriting three verified paths to introduce a helper buys no user-visible
behaviour and hands back a real regression surface. It owns the queries promote
needs, and is where those three belong when one of them next needs editing anyway.

Every function answers with None on failure rather than raising. A promote precondition
that cannot resolve the repository must produce a readable block reason, not a traceback
from inside a subprocess call four frames down.
