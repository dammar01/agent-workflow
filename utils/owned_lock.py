"""O_EXCL lock file that knows who holds it.

The fact store, the knowledge store, and the browser-knowledge store each used to carry a
private copy of the same lock: create the file with O_EXCL, and when it already exists,
steal it once its mtime was older than a TTL or once a deadline passed. Two failures hid
in that shape, and both were POSIX-only because Windows refuses to unlink a file whose
handle is open:

* A live holder that ran past the TTL — a swapped-out process, a slow disk — had its lock
  taken from under it, and two writers then ran the read-modify-write at the same time.
* The holder's exit unlinked the path unconditionally. Once its lock had been stolen, the
  path belonged to the next writer, so the first writer's exit deleted a lock it no longer
  owned and let a third writer in beside the second.

This lock writes `{pid, token}` into the file. A lock is taken over only when its owner
is provably gone: the recorded pid is not running, or the file is unreadable and older
than the TTL (a writer that crashed between create and write). A live owner is waited
for up to the deadline and then reported as `TimeoutError` — waiting longer would hang
the caller, and taking the lock would bring back the concurrent write this exists to
stop. Release removes the file only while it still carries this holder's token.
