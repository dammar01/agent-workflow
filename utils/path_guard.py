# `validate_scope` used to live here: it scanned the TASK TEXT for sensitive filenames
# and out-of-root paths before dispatch. It was removed in v3.4.1 because it guarded the
# wrong thing. Naming a file is not reading one, so it rejected an audit whose
# instructions merely mentioned the files it was auditing, while a run that never spelled
# the name out reached exactly the same data. Its own docstring admitted the real boundary
# was elsewhere ("opencode enforces the hard boundary") — that boundary now exists and is
# enforced on the tool call itself: `permission.read` / `permission.grep` deny rules in
# dist/config/opencode/opencode.project.json, plus `external_directory: deny` for
# out-of-root access. Enforcement belongs where the file is opened, not where it is typed.
