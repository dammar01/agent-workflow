# statusline.sh - Claude Code statusline (POSIX parity of statusline.ps1)
# Renders: <project> | Second Agent <tokens> (<cached>) / <calls> | Saved <tokens>
# Every figure is scoped to the CURRENT session.
#
# Second Agent = every token the provider processed for calls bound to this session's
#                MAIN_SESSION_ID, cache read included, falling back to the char-derived
#                estimate on rows no provider counted. The cached share is printed in
#                brackets: on an agentic run it is ~95% of the figure, and a number that
#                large with no explanation beside it reads as a bug rather than a fact.
# Saved        = what the second agent handled that NEVER reached this context: the files
#                and tool output it ingested (fresh input) plus the reasoning it spent
#                (inside output, never emitted as text). Both are facts about where the
#                tokens went, not estimates.
#                Excluded on purpose: cache read, which is the same context re-sent at
#                every internal step rather than new material, and the answer text itself,
#                which DOES arrive here. Claiming the answer as saved would credit the
#                main agent for not reading what it just read.
#                Rows no provider counted cannot answer this - the estimate there measures
#                the prompt, not what was read - so they fall back to
#                premium_context_avoided_tokens and the figure carries `~`, the same
#                measured-else-estimated rule as billable_input/billable_output.
#
# Both numbers carry `~` while any part of them fell back to a char-derived estimate. A
# session whose rows were all provider-counted carries no mark, because nothing in it is
# a guess.
#
# Input: statusline JSON on stdin. Output: single line on stdout.
# Never fails the prompt (always exit 0). JSON via python3 (bash 3.2 safe).
