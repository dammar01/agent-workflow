# graph-refresh.sh - Stop hook (POSIX parity of graph-refresh.ps1).
# Regenerates graphify-out/ after main_agent actually changed code. Two gates:
#   1. Did this turn implement? ([EXECUTION RESULT] / [REFACTOR RESULT] in last message)
#   2. Is the graph older than the sources? (mtime compare, skip dirs pruned before descent)
# Both must pass. The refresh is detached (DEC-012): the hook starts a worker that runs
# `graphify update` only (never init/build/watch) with no time limit (DEC-042), beats the
# lock while it runs, records one row in the quality stream, and removes
# graphify-out/.refresh.lock. Readers treat the graph as stale while the lock is held,
# because graphify rewrites graph.json in place.
# Never blocks the response (always exit 0).
