Aggregates only. Every figure below is counted from metadata fields of a fixed prefix of
the usage stream. No prompt text, task text, source code, or evidence content was read.

## Context

The maintainer's own use of agent-workflow while developing agent-workflow itself: one
person, one machine, one repository, uncontrolled. The runtime records telemetry in the
project's `.workflow/` workspace as a side effect of normal use.

## Task

Everyday maintenance and feature work on this repository, through the delegated commands
(`explore`, `analyze`, `plan`, `verify`).

## Workflow

Delegated calls run through `.workflow/run` as background jobs. Each call appends one row
per provider invocation to `.workflow/data/usage.jsonl`.

## Observation

Source: the first 255 lines of `.workflow/data/usage.jsonl`, recorded 2026-08-15 ..
2026-09-27 (UTC). The stream is append-only; later rows do not change these lines.

255 provider rows form 238 work units. A work unit groups rows that share a `prompt_id`;
a continuation adds a row to the same unit — the same grouping as
`core/audit/telemetry.py` `_work_groups`.

**Latency per work unit** (seconds, sum of the unit's measured rows; p90 by nearest rank):

| Command | n | min | median | p90 | max |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| explore | 61 | 4 | 218 | 394 | 612 |
| plan | 40 | 2 | 225 | 473 | 663 |
| analyze | 39 | 12 | 299 | 493 | 1414 |
| verify | 98 | 10 | 185 | 405 | 1544 |

**Verification outcome.** Of 98 verify work units: 59 `fail`, 38 `incomplete`, 1 without a
verdict, **0 `pass`**. `accepted` was true in none of them.

**Evidence reuse.** `reused_evidence` and `provider_call_avoided` were false on every row
(0 of 255).

## Evidence

Re-counted by the maintainer on 2026-09-27 directly from the first 255 lines of
`.workflow/data/usage.jsonl`, using the fields `command`, `prompt_id`, `verdict`,
`accepted`, `duration_seconds`, `reused_evidence`, and `provider_call_avoided`. The figures
were first drafted by the secondary agent; the re-count matched them. Drafted figures from other sources (evidence, facts,
call metadata, jobs, quality rows, recurrence cache) were not re-counted and are removed.

## Outcome

`inconclusive` — a description of use, not a test of any hypothesis.

## Unexpected behavior

- **No verify unit passed.** The data cannot say why; a per-unit look was not done.
- **Evidence reuse never fired** in this prefix.

## Limitations

- One operator who is also the tool's author, on the tool's own repository. This supports
  only that something *can* happen.
- Development use: many calls exercised features under construction, which distorts
  verdicts and durations compared with ordinary use.
- Durations include the secondary agent's own reading; they are not comparable to direct
  use without a matched task.
- `.workflow/` is git-ignored: the figures are reproducible only where the stream exists.

## Related research

- Draft CASE-002 (team latency complaints) cites this case as maintainer-only data.
- Draft records H-001, H-004, H-005, H-007 and EXP-002 cite this case; they are kept
  locally in `docs/research-drafts/` and are not tracked.
