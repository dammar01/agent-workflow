"""Which provider CLI release a call ran on, and whether this workflow version was tested on it.

Each provider bundle in config/providers.py names the release it was tested against
(`stable_version`). A delegated call and doctor read the installed release with
`<cli> --version` and compare: `stable` when it matches, `untested` when it does not,
`unreadable` when the CLI did not answer. Advisory only: an untested release still runs,
because refusing would block a user on a release that may work; the status is what a failure
report has to name, and the stable release is the one to pin back to (CASE-015).

Reading costs a process spawn on the delegated path (measured: about 1.2 s for opencode's
node shim, 0.3 s for codex), so a reading is also kept on disk across runs, keyed by the
resolved executable's path, mtime and size: an upgrade that rewrites the file is a new key.
A shim an upgrade leaves untouched would keep an old reading, so an entry also expires after
`_CACHE_MAX_AGE_SECONDS`. A CLI that exits without a readable version is cached too (as
null), so it is not asked again on every run; a timeout or a failed spawn is not. Fail-open
throughout: a cache that cannot be read or written only means the version is read again.
