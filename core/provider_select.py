"""Read and write the second_agent selection: provider, model, effort.

The picker that drives this lives in the main agent (`AskUserQuestion` has no subagent
form), so the model would otherwise be the thing editing `second_agent.json` by hand.
It is not: the model passes one string and every decision about whether that string is
writable happens here, in code that `checks/provider.py` can run.

Two modes, told apart by whether a payload was given:

    provider ""                            -> the catalog plus what is selected now
    provider "codex|gpt-5.6-luna|high"     -> validate, then write
    provider "codex|gpt-5.6-luna|high|explore=gpt-5.5,plan=gpt-5.6-luna"
                                           -> the same, with per-route models

`|` separates the fields because opencode model ids contain `/`.

An apply writes FIVE keys together — provider, provider_command, provider_agent,
default_model, effort. Writing `provider` alone is exactly the failure
`config.settings.foreign_provider_values` exists to report: codex selected, opencode's
binary and opencode's `plan` persona still on disk, and a workspace describing something
that does not exist. So the write is whole, and the report runs afterwards as proof.

`routes` is written with them, for the same reason one field ahead of the others is not
enough. `Router.route` reads `routes.<command>.model` BEFORE `default_model`
(`core/router.py:57`), so a selection that touched only `default_model` left every route
pointing at the model the user had just replaced — the new model written down, the old
one still running, and nothing anywhere saying so. Absent a routes field the payload
means "all of them follow the default", which is the shape that cannot drift.

Only the delegated commands are selectable: the rest of `COMMAND_ROUTES` never reaches a
provider, so offering a model for them would be a question with no consequence. Route
entries are merged key-wise rather than replaced — `timeout_seconds` and `agent` live
there too (`core/router.py:61,75`) and belong to the user, not to this command.
