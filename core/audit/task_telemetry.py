"""Tasks as sequences of skill calls, closed by a verify the runtime derives as pass
(DEC-015, revised by DEC-020).

Events come from two writers into `tasks.jsonl`: the runtime records each delegated
command it runs, and the `task-events` hook records what never passes through it — a
local skill invoked from the prompt, a file edited, a commit made. Since event v2 the hook
reads a commit as a HEAD that moved between turns (UserPromptSubmit/Stop) rather than from
every Bash call, so a commit is recorded at the end of the turn that made it, after that
turn's verify. Nothing is derived at write time; the hook stays a few lines of append, and a
better reading of the same history needs no migration.

A task is the run of events in one MAIN_SESSION_ID from its first event until a verify
whose derived verdict is `pass` after the task edited something. A commit is the
recommended next step, not the closing one: a commit that includes a file of a task just
completed joins that task's sequence, and a commit on an open task leaves it open. Its state:

- `completed`: closed by a derived `pass` with no edit since.
- `open`: edits not yet verified `pass`, committed or not.
- `read_only`: skills ran, nothing was edited; nothing for a verify to close.
- `unknown`: events without a session identity, which cannot be put in a task.

The derived verdict is read, not the declared one (DEC-020): a DONE the runtime turns into
`incomplete` — a gap under not_verified included — does not close a task. Events written
before DEC-020 carry no derived verdict, and their tasks stay open.
