"""Reading side of the governance trail.

`.workflow/audit.jsonl` has been written on every delegated call since the trail existed,
and read by nothing. A record nobody can open is a record only in the sense that the
bytes are on disk: the whole reason audit is a stream separate from usage is that someone
consults it after an incident, and until now that someone had to `cat` a JSONL file and
count by eye.

Kept out of `telemetry.py` on purpose, for the same reason the streams are separate.
Telemetry measures and may be recomputed under a better definition; audit answers "what
was done, by which provider, and did anything get scrubbed on the way". Merging the two
readers would eventually let a change to a metric reshape the record.

Deliberately NOT a rate. Every figure here is a count over rows that exist, because the
question an audit answers is "what happened", and a percentage invites the reader to
treat an empty trail as a clean one.
