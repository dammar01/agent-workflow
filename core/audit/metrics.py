"""The calculation contract: every benchmark figure has an ID, a version and a stated method.

Three producers compute figures this project reports: the runtime's `--command report`
(`core/audit/telemetry.py`, `task_telemetry.py`) and the two offline tools
`tools/maintain/measure_real_use.py` and `measure_task_outcomes.py`. They used the same words
for different things — "task" meant a correlation id, a session run closed by a verify pass,
and a labelled transcript; "saved" had three formulas — and their statistics differ. This
registry does not unify them, because doing so would silently change figures already recorded
(CASE-011, CASE-012). It names each one apart, states exactly how it is computed, and versions
it: a figure is cited as `<id>@<version>`, and a change to how a metric is computed bumps its
version instead of quietly meaning something else.

Every producer also stamps its output with `provenance()`: the registry version, the tool,
the tool's commit, the parameters it ran with, and a hash over its inputs. The inputs are
private (Claude Code transcripts, usage streams, project git history), so a figure can be
recounted only on the machine that holds them: any user can measure their own use with the
same tools, and nobody can recount another user's figure. `RECOUNT` says so in every stamp.
`write_export` writes a figure set that may leave that machine: aggregates and the stamp,
refused when any value falls outside an allowlist of identifier shapes or holds a project name.

The registry is documented in docs/evaluation/metrics.md; a test keeps the two in step.
