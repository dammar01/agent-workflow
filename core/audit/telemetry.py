"""Aggregation over the usage stream. Reads history, never writes it.

Every metric here is DERIVED at read time from `UsageRecord` rows rather than counted as
calls happen. That is the whole design: a counter incremented at runtime freezes one
definition of a metric forever, and the definitions in this file are exactly the ones
worth being able to change later — "accepted", "rework", and "first-pass correct" are
judgement calls, not facts. Re-deriving means a better definition re-reads history
instead of invalidating it.

Every metric also reports its own denominator. A rate computed over four calls and a rate
computed over four hundred are different claims, and a dashboard that shows only the
percentage lets the reader mistake the first for the second.
