"""Shared OpenCode config merge policy.

Both writers of an opencode config go through here: `install.py` (global
~/.config/opencode) and `core.workflow_runtime` (the project boundary at
<project_root>/opencode.json). The rules are a security boundary, so they live in one
module rather than being reimplemented on each side — a second copy is a second thing to
forget when the deny-list changes.

Reporting is a `warn(message)` callable instead of install.py's Plan object: the runtime
side has no Plan, and the merge itself has no business knowing how its caller renders.
