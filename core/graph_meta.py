"""Provenance, commit awareness, and per-node verification for a graph this repo cannot build.

Graphify is an external CLI (PyPI `graphifyy`); `graphify-out/graph.json` arrives already
written and nothing here can change how it is produced. That ruled out the obvious design
— add fields to the nodes — and for a while it looked like it ruled out the feature.

It does not, because the graph already carries the hard part. Every node states its
`source_file` and `source_location`, which is provenance down to the line. What was
missing is everything ABOUT that provenance: which commit it was true at, and whether the
line it points to still says what it said. Both are computable here, from the repo, and
both go in a sidecar keyed by node id rather than into a file this repo does not own.

Verification reuses the mechanism the fact store already trusts: hash the referenced
line's text, compare later. That gives per-node invalidation, which is strictly better
than what `graph_index.is_stale()` can do — a whole-graph mtime verdict condemns every
node in the graph the moment one file is touched, so the honest answer ("these nine nodes
moved, the other twelve hundred are fine") was not expressible.
