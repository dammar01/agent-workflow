"""Local, cheap verification for `/.verify` when commands.verify_mode is "syntax".

Answers one narrow question: do the files this session touched still parse, and do
they reference names that exist? It deliberately does NOT run the project's test
suite — that is the whole point of the "syntax" mode.

Anything it cannot check is reported as `not_checked` / `skipped`, never as a pass:
a silent gap here would be exactly the false-safety signal this command exists to avoid.
