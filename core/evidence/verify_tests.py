"""Tests for /.verify: chosen by main_agent, run by the runtime, judged beside the review.

The second agent verifies by reading and tracing only. When it also ran tests, providers
diverged: codex ran whole suites (CASE-010: verify medians up to 366 s), opencode could run
none and every such verify came back `incomplete` (CASE-009). Now main_agent picks the tests
that cover the change and its dependents and writes them, with its reason, to the session's
request file before calling verify:

    .workflow/data/sessions/<MAIN_SESSION_ID>/verify/tests.json
    {"commands": ["python tests/run.py --only installer"], "reason": "installer changed"}

`commands: []` with a reason says no test covers the change. The runtime runs a command only
when it starts with a prefix the project lists in `commands.verify_test_commands`, with no
shell (no `&&`, pipes, redirects, substitution or control characters), one at a time,
each under `commands.verify_test_timeout_seconds`. Results are written into the
[VERIFICATION] block the second agent returned, which never sees them: `checks_run` gets one
runtime line per command; a failing, timed-out or unrunnable command is a blocking finding
(origin `unknown`, so it fails closed); a refused command or a missing or unusable request
is a `not_verified` gap under the `tests:` prefix, which the validator reads as a
`runtime_gap` — never the gap-only exit 0 an agent's own declared gap earns. The verdict is
then derived from the block as usual, so `pass` needs green tests and a review with no
blocking finding. `commands: []` adds a visible `checks_run` line that is not counted as an
executed check: the verdict then rests on the checks the review itself ran.

The tests run after the provider has finished, when nothing else beats the job's heartbeat:
`apply` takes the delegated call's progress callback and beats it (phase `runtime_tests`)
before each command and every `HEARTBEAT_SECONDS` while one runs.

The request is consumed: it is renamed to `tests.used.json` once its results are written
into the verify result, so a later verify never reruns an old choice silently.
