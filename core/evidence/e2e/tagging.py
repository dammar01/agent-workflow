"""Turning elements a run actually drove into `data-e2e` tags in the project's source.

A run already knows something no reader of the codebase does: which element a step really
hit, which of the draft's candidate selectors won, and how many elements matched. That is
worth writing down — but writing it down means editing the user's own templates, so every
step here is narrow on purpose.

What may be tagged: an element whose step PASSED, whose winning selector had provenance
`source`, and whose `selector_provenance.ref` names a `path:line` in this project. That
last condition is the whole boundary. There is no map from a runtime selector back to the
template that rendered it, so the only elements with a real address are the ones the draft
already cited one for. A selector found by heuristic or by probing the live DOM is left
alone rather than guessed at: a tag written to the wrong line is a silent edit to code
nobody asked to change.

What is never used: the live DOM. `page.content()` describes what the browser rendered,
not what the repository contains, and patching source from it would write framework output
back over the template that produced it.

This module proposes and validates; it does not decide. The runner records the plan, the
user confirms the batch, and only then is a line rewritten — the one interactive gate
/.verify-browser keeps, because it is the one step that changes files the user owns.
