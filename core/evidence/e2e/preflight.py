"""What has to be true before a browser run is worth starting.

Each check names the `incomplete` reason it produces, so a run that cannot happen says
why in one word the user can act on. None of this touches Playwright at import time;
`browser_available` imports it inside the call and only after `playwright_available`
said it was there.

Where a run may point and what it may write to are two different questions. Navigation
policy is about names: loopback, a `.test` name (reserved for local development, so it
cannot be a public host), or an origin the user typed into `allowed_origins` behind
`allow_remote`. Write policy treats loopback and `.test` alike — both are local
development by definition and take writes without a lookup. Every other host that may
receive a write is judged by address: it has to resolve to loopback or a private range,
and the address it resolved to here is pinned into the browser so the answer cannot
change afterwards.
