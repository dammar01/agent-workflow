"""The real browser player: one resolved scenario through Playwright, reported as the
`classify.py` event protocol.

Split in two on purpose. `run_scenario` imports Playwright lazily (an optional extra —
tests/checks/deps.py), launches, and always closes. `Session` drives a page that is
already open, so the step semantics — selector fallback, polling assertions, origin
guard, observers — are checked against a stand-in page without a browser.

What never leaves this process: typed values (fill/select/press echo no input), full
DOM, request or response bodies, queries, cookies. What does leave is scrubbed again by
the runner before anything is stored or prompted.

A write action runs once. A timeout after the click was dispatched may still mean the
server received the request, so nothing here re-sends it; the step fails with evidence.
