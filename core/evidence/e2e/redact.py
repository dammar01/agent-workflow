"""Redaction for everything the e2e stages write down.

Three rules, in order of how often they matter:
  1. the resolved scenario (placeholders replaced by real values) is handed to the
     player's stdin/argv only and never to disk, a prompt, or a result;
  2. every artifact this package writes (spec, events, report, evidence block) goes
     through the shared secret scanner first, the same one delegated output goes
     through, so a value that leaks through a page title or an error message is
     caught by the same patterns everywhere;
  3. input values recorded by the player are dropped, not redacted — a `fill` step's
     evidence is that it ran, never what it typed;
  4. a resolved value is scrubbed in every form a page echoes it in (raw, URL-encoded,
     HTML- and JSON-escaped), in events and in player-written text files alike. Binary
     files cannot be scrubbed, so the player does not write them once values resolved.
