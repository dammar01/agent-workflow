"""Turn player events into a browser verdict with an origin per failure.

Three origins, not two. `app` means the evidence says the application broke the claim;
`harness` means the evidence says the scenario or the runtime broke; `unknown` means
the evidence cannot tell — and `unknown` is never promoted to `harness`, because that
is exactly the move that would hide a regression behind a flaky-selector story.
