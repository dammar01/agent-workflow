"""The per-invocation request behind /.verify-browser.

The skill interviews the user, then writes one JSON file for the session:

  .workflow/data/sessions/<session>/e2e/request.json
  {"version": 1, "phase": "draft" | "run", "settings": {...},
   "scenario": {...}, "existing_tests": [...], "spec_notes": [...]}

`draft` asks second_agent for a spec and stops before any browser starts; `run` executes
the scenario the user confirmed. Settings resolve in three layers, each overriding the one
before it: the shipped defaults below, the project's `e2e` section in `.workflow/config.json`
(so a configured project runs without being interviewed again), then the request's own
`settings` for what this one run does differently. Two sessions verifying two apps on one
project still diverge freely — they just start from the same pinned base. Hybrid review is
not a knob — it always runs.

The request is written by an agent, so it cannot also be where the policy that governs it
lives. CONFIG_ONLY_SETTINGS — which remote origins a run may reach and which command runs
the project's own tests — resolve from config.json alone; a request naming one is refused.
A request may still pick its `base_url`, and that URL is judged by the config's policy.

Credentials never travel in the request. `${NAME}` placeholders resolve from one profile of
`.workflow/e2e/secrets.json`, then from the process environment:

  {"default": "qa",
   "profiles": [{"name": "qa", "credentials": {"E2E_USER": "...", "E2E_PASS": "..."}},
                {"name": "admin", "credentials": {"E2E_USER": "...", "E2E_PASS": "..."}}]}

The request picks a profile by name (`settings.secrets_profile`), never by value, so trying
another account is another run with another name. Which NAMES exist is decided here, in
CREDENTIAL_KEYS — not by the scenario, and not by whatever second_agent wrote.
