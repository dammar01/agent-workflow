"""What earlier browser runs learned about the application, reused by the next draft.

The browser-side counterpart of `core/evidence/fact_store.py`, at the same level: written
automatically from runs, anchored where it can be, aged out on its own, never tracked by
Git. Knowledge worth sharing is lifted into Git through `/.promote`
(`promotable_claims`), exactly as facts are.

What a run records, per application origin (scheme://host:port of base_url):

  auth.login    the steps from the login page's goto through the first assertion after the
                password was typed — how this app signs in
  auth.logout   the step that signed out, when a later assertion proved the login page came
                back
  navigation    a route a goto reached
  page_ready    a route's readiness conditions that held
  selector      a selector that matched exactly one element for an action on a route
  failure_hint  a selector a run could not use, with the diagnosis that says why
                (`classify.diagnose`, reusable causes only) — what the next draft should
                not propose again as it was

Only what a run PROVED is recorded: a step that passed, in a run that passed on its first
attempt, that wrote nothing. A step that fails against a recorded entry counts against it,
and STALE_AFTER_FAILS consecutive failures retire it — the page changed, and a hint that
no longer matches is worse than no hint.

Nothing here holds a credential. Entries are built from the PLACEHOLDER scenario the
runner archives (`${E2E_USER}`, never its value), and a `fill` value that is not a
placeholder is dropped rather than stored: typed test data is not application knowledge.
