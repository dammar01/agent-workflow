"""Who may run a delegated call, with what tools, and how much it may spend.

Three controls that were previously either documented or enforced somewhere the runtime
could not see. Each one states plainly where its teeth actually are, because a governance
control that is weaker than it sounds is worse than an absent one — it gets trusted.

  * Provider allowlist — REAL enforcement. A route naming an unregistered provider is
    refused here, before anything spawns.
  * Budget ceiling — REAL enforcement, on recorded history. Bounded by what the usage
    stream knows: a call in flight has not been recorded yet, so a ceiling can be crossed
    by at most the calls running concurrently.
  * Per-command tool permission — DECLARATION, not enforcement. The hard boundary is the
    provider's own permission config (see dist/config/opencode/opencode.project.json);
    this narrows it per command and writes down what was asked for. Named a declaration
    everywhere it appears so nobody reads it as a sandbox.
