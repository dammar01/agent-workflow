    (opencode: "Session not found") before doing any work. Threads are now kept per
    provider in `provider_sessions`; `provider_session_id` stays as the active provider's
    entry because every reader of the record (adapters, recovery, the e2e continuation)
    already reads that key.

    A bare id on a record that was never bound to a provider — a pre-3.6.0 record, or one
    written before its first call (recovery stores the captured id that way) — is adopted
    only when its shape fits the provider now selected, otherwise dropped: a fresh thread
    costs one bootstrap, a foreign resume costs the call. Once bound, a record never
    adopts again, so a switch cannot inherit the previous provider's id. codex and agy ids
    are indistinguishable by shape, so an unbound id from one can still be offered to the
    other once.
