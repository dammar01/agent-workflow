"""Did the second_agent write to the workspace? Asked before and after every agy call.

Every other provider answers this by construction. OpenCode is held to a `permission`
block that `core/opencode_policy.py` overwrites rather than merges, and codex runs under
`--sandbox read-only`. agy has neither, and not for want of looking: `--sandbox` and
`--mode plan` were both probed against the shipped binary and changed nothing — same 56
tools, same `permission_mode: always-proceed`, `write_to_file` and `run_command` among
them. Dropping `--dangerously-skip-permissions` does move the mode to `request-review`,
but that mode refuses EVERY tool, reads included, which leaves a provider that cannot
gather evidence. There is no third setting and no config file to write one into: agy keeps
nothing under the user's home but `bin/`.

So the boundary cannot be enforced, and this module does not pretend otherwise. It
DETECTS. The write has already happened by the time the second snapshot is taken; what
this buys is that the change is named in the result instead of discovered days later in a
diff nobody attributed to a delegated call.

Three things it does not see, stated here rather than in a footnote, because a guard
trusted past its range is worse than no guard:

  * anything matched by .gitignore — build output, caches, .env
  * any project that is not a git repository, where it reports itself unavailable
  * a file written and restored within the same call

`git status --porcelain` is the whole mechanism. It is fast enough to run twice per
delegated call on a large repo, it already understands the ignore rules, and it needs no
state of our own to keep in sync.
