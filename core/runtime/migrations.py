"""Versioned workspace migrations, run by `upgrade` (and by init's auto-upgrade).

A migration is a step from one `LAYOUT_VERSION` to the next. Each is idempotent: it
decides from what is on disk whether there is anything to do, so a second upgrade is a
no-op and a half-finished one is finished or rolled back, never repeated on top of itself.

Layout 1 → 2 (3.7.0): everything internal moves from the `.workflow` root into
`.workflow/data/`, leaving the root to the files a person edits. In order:

  1. back the whole `.workflow` tree up to `data/backups/<stamp>/` (last BACKUPS_KEPT kept);
  2. take the fact, evidence, browser-knowledge and promote locks, so no writer is
     mid-rewrite while its file moves;
  3. move every internal item into `.workflow/data.migrating/`, then rename that to
     `data/` in one step — the moment `data/` exists every reader (runtime, hooks, run
     scripts) switches layout, so it must never exist half-filled;
  4. point the evidence index's archived artifact paths at their new location;
  5. delete the pre-session root leftovers (`state.json`, `scope.json`,
     `command-cache.json`, `runtime/`, `logs/`) and the old lock files;
  6. strip config.json to overrides (values equal to a default, unknown or retired keys);
  7. convert a `secrets.json` still in the pre-list shape, keeping its values.

A failure before step 3's rename moves everything back and removes the temporary
directory; the backup is kept either way and its path reported.

Steps 4-7 run after the rename, where moving back is no longer the safe direction: every
reader has already switched to data/. They roll forward instead. The rename carries a
`.migration-pending.json` into data/ listing them; each one removes itself once done, and
a later upgrade finishes whatever is still listed. Each step is idempotent, so one that
completed before its entry was cleared simply runs again as a no-op.

A leftover `data.migrating/` whose entries also exist at the root is refused, not merged:
neither copy is provably the newer one, and `shutil.move` onto an existing name nests a
directory or silently replaces a file.
