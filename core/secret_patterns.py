"""The one list of secret-file patterns, and each provider's dialect of it.

The deny-list used to exist once, as JSON, inside `dist/config/opencode/opencode.project.json`.
That was fine while opencode was the only provider that could express a read boundary. It
stops being fine the moment a second provider needs the SAME list in a different syntax:
two copies of a security list drift, and the copy that drifts is the one nobody reads.

So the patterns live here in one canonical form, and each provider gets a translator:

* opencode consumes them as its own glob dialect (`*.env`, `*.ssh/*`) written into a
  project-scoped `opencode.json`. That file is still shipped as a static artifact — this
  module does not rewrite it — and `tests/checks/provider.py` asserts the two agree, so a change
  here that never reaches the JSON fails a check instead of silently halving the boundary.
* codex consumes them as TOML filesystem permissions passed with `-c` on every invocation.
  Codex has no project-scoped config file at all (a `.codex/config.toml` in a project root
  is simply not loaded), so its boundary cannot be installed once; it rides on the argv of
  each call. See `codex_filesystem_permissions()`.

  READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING THE CODEX HALF: as of codex-cli 0.147.0 those permissions stop
  nothing. Denying `**` and `**/*` for `:workspace_roots` and then asking `codex exec` for a
  file returns that file at exit 0 — codex reads by spawning a shell, and `--sandbox
  read-only` bounds writes rather than reads. The flags stay because they are four argv
  elements and become real the day codex gates shell reads, but the enforced boundary today
  is opencode's alone. `adapters/codex_install.py` reports this as `not_enforceable`.

Verified against codex-cli 0.147.0: `[permissions.<profile>.filesystem]` is a real config
section, an access value of `"none"` is accepted, `"read-write"` is not (the enum rejects
it), and a `[permissions]` block requires `default_permissions` to name the active profile.

What that probe did NOT establish is whether codex's glob matcher lets `*` match a leading
dot. The distinction is the whole boundary for the files that matter most: if it does not,
`**/*.npmrc` covers `app.npmrc` and leaves `.npmrc` open, and the same hole swallows `.env`,
`.netrc`, `.pgpass` and `.git-credentials`. So `codex_secret_globs()` ships BOTH spellings
of every pattern rather than betting on the permissive reading. The duplicate costs one
extra map entry each; the bet would have cost the secret.

# Canonical patterns, written in opencode's dialect because that is the dialect already
# shipped in dist/. Everything else translates FROM this.
#
# `*.key` is deliberately broad. It costs the agent access to a handful of innocent files
# named `something.key`; it buys refusing every private key that follows the convention.
# `*.tfvars` is the same trade: most of them hold no secret, but the ones that do hold the
# whole cloud account, and nothing in the name tells the two apart.
#
# The directory patterns (`.ssh`, `.aws`, `.gnupg`, `.kube`, `.docker`) deny the directory
# rather than the credential file inside it. `.kube/config` and `.docker/config.json` are
# named `config`, so a file-name pattern precise enough to catch them would also catch every
# ordinary config in the tree. Note the leading dot is literal here: a plain `docker/` full
# of Dockerfiles does not match, only the dotted home-directory form does.
