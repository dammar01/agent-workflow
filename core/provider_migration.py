"""One-shot migration of the v3.4.2 OpenCode-named keys to provider-agnostic ones.

The rename in v3.4.3 is a hard one — no read-side aliases — so this is the only thing
standing between an existing workspace and silent data loss. Worth being precise about
why `_merge_provider_config` cannot do the job: that function is additive by contract
("an existing value is the user's tuning"), so on its own it would write the new keys at
their DEFAULTS, leave the old keys orphaned, and the user's tuning would vanish without
an error anywhere. Migration therefore moves values, then removes the old key.

Three surfaces, each idempotent and safe to re-run:
  * .workflow/second_agent.json  <- .workflow/opencode.json  (file + key rename)
  * .workflow/config.json        runtime.opencode_config -> runtime.provider_config
  * storage/sessions/*.json      opencode_session_id -> provider_session_id

The session rewrite matters more than it looks: those files carry the resumable
provider session, and dropping the field would make every existing session re-bootstrap
— quota spent to reproduce state that was already on disk.
