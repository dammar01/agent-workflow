"""The freshness ladder: is a promoted claim still supported by the code it cites?

Four rungs, cheapest first, and the order is the whole point:

    verified_commit == HEAD   -> nothing in the repository moved; no file is read
    blob_oid unchanged        -> nothing in THIS file moved; the file is not read
    anchor still locatable    -> the cited line survives, possibly at a new number
    otherwise                 -> needs verification by someone who can read

Going straight to the anchor check would be correct and slow: it reads and hashes every
cited file on every retrieval. Stopping at the blob check would be fast and wrong: a
touched comment changes the blob while the cited line is untouched, and calling that
"stale" retires knowledge that is still true.

The anchor rung is borrowed rather than rebuilt. core/evidence/fact_store.py already
solved "where does this line live now", including the relocation case, and a second
implementation would be a second set of bugs.
