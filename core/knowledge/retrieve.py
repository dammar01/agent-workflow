"""Choosing which promoted knowledge a delegated call should see, and whether it applies.

Two questions the pack keeps apart, and so does this module:

    validity      is the claim still true in production?          -> verify.py
    applicability is it safe to describe the branch in hand?      -> here

They come apart on any feature branch. Knowledge verified on main stays true of main
while the branch under the developer's hands deliberately changes it, and a retrieval
layer that only asked the first question would hand the agent a confident, correct,
irrelevant answer.

Divergence is resolved per document, never globally. A branch that rewrites
authentication says nothing about payment, and blanking every document because one of
them is under construction throws away the knowledge the session most likely needs.
