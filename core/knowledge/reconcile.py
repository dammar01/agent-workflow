"""Old promoted claims versus freshly verified candidates: what changed, and how badly.

Five outcomes, decided by rules applied in order, stopping at the first match:

    1. no existing claim under this id                       -> NEW
    2. the candidate failed fresh verification                -> UNVERIFIED
    3. statements match after normalisation                   -> UNCHANGED
    4. same type, statement differs, every source verified    -> UPDATE
    5. anything else                                          -> CONFLICT

Rule 2 sits above the comparison rules on purpose. A candidate whose evidence did not
hold up is not a smaller version of an update; it is an absence of knowledge, and
letting it reach rule 4 would let unverified text overwrite verified text.

Rule 5 is where the authority collision lands: an existing claim sourced from a user
clarification, contradicted by fresh code. Neither side is obviously right — the code
may have drifted from the intent, or the intent may have been revised and never written
down — so it goes to the user rather than to a heuristic.
