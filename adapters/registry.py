"""Name -> adapter resolution for second_agent.

Before v3.4.3 there was no selection step at all: `core/executor.py` named
`OpenCodeAdapter` in its own constructor, and config.json's `second_agent` key was
written but never read. This module is the missing half — the key is now the input to
a lookup, so adding a provider means registering a class here rather than editing the
executor.

Selection order, first hit wins:
  1. explicit `name` argument (tests, CLI overrides)
  2. `provider` in the workspace .workflow/second_agent.json
  3. AI_PROXY_PROVIDER / the built-in default

`runtime.second_agent` in .workflow/config.json is a HINT, not a choice. v3.4.3 let it
select, and the result was a project that named codex there running every call against
`provider_command: "opencode"` — the two keys live in different files and nothing made
them agree, so the adapter and the binary it was pointed at came from different answers.
One file now owns the decision: second_agent.json carries `provider` AND the command that
matches it, and a config.json naming something else is reported through
`provider_hint_ignored` rather than acted on.
