"""Codex-specific workspace installation.

The three functions `config/providers.py` dispatches through — `load_config`,
`merge_policy`, `install_project_config` — are the provider-facing contract. Everything
else here is codex's own business.

Codex's answer to those three is mostly "not applicable", and that is a design choice
rather than a stub:

* Codex keeps its config in `~/.codex/config.toml`. Every value in it can be overridden
  per invocation with `-c key=value`, and the sandbox has its own `-s` flag, so
  `adapters/codex_adapter.py` asserts the read-only boundary on EVERY call instead of
  writing it into a file once. A merged config file can be edited afterwards and nothing
  would notice; an argv flag cannot. There is therefore no global config to merge, and
  the bundle ships no template for one.
* Codex has no project-root config LAYER at all, so there is no project file to install
  either. `[permissions.<profile>.filesystem]` parses and is reachable through a `-c`
  override, so the read boundary was written to follow the same route as the sandbox:
  asserted on every call.

  It does not work. Probed against codex-cli 0.147.0 in `exec` mode: denying `**` and
  `**/*` for `:workspace_roots` and then asking for a file returns that file's contents,
  exit 0. Codex reads by running a shell command, `--sandbox read-only` governs writes
  rather than reads (its own `--help` says the sandbox policy applies "when executing
  model-generated shell commands"), and nothing routes a shell read through the permission
  map. So `install_project_config` reports `not_enforceable` with a zero count. The flags
  are still sent — they cost four argv elements and would start working the day codex gates
  shell reads — but a count of patterns SENT was being read as a count of patterns
  ENFORCED, and a security report that overstates is worse than one that is absent.

    """No file is installed, and no read boundary holds — reported as `not_enforceable`.

    OpenCode's `<project_root>/opencode.json` denies reading `.env` and friends, and that
    denial is what makes its second agent safe to point at a repository holding secrets.
    Codex cannot be given the same file: a `.codex/config.toml` sitting in a project root is
    not part of any config layer codex loads, verified by planting an unknown key in one and
    watching `--strict-config` accept the run without complaint.

    `[permissions.<profile>.filesystem]` looked like the way back to the same guarantee. It
    parses — `--strict-config` accepts the override, and dropping `default_permissions`
    produces a specific complaint about it — so this once reported `enforced_per_call` and
    counted the patterns. Probing 0.147.0 showed the count described nothing: with `**` and
    `**/*` denied for `:workspace_roots`, `codex exec` still returned the contents of a file
    in that root at exit 0. Codex reads by spawning a shell, and `--sandbox read-only` bounds
    what a shell may WRITE.

    So the two numbers below describe different things on purpose. `permissions_declared` is
    what rides on the argv; `permissions_enforced` is what any of it is known to stop, and it
    is 0 until a codex release gates shell reads. Collapsing the two is what made a workflow
    that reads `.env` freely look, in doctor output, like one that cannot.

    `path` stays None: nothing was written, and claiming a path would invite someone to go
    looking for it.
