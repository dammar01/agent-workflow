"""agy-specific workspace installation.

The three functions `config/providers.py` dispatches through — `load_config`,
`merge_policy`, `install_project_config` — are the provider-facing contract. This module
exists to answer them, and its answer is that agy has no boundary to install.

That is a finding, not a stub. Codex's equivalent reports `not_enforceable` because its
permission map parses and then fails to stop a shell read. agy's case is one step worse:
there is nothing to install anywhere, and nothing that would hold if there were.

What was probed against the shipped binary, in `--output-format stream-json` where the
`init` event states the mode and the tool list outright:

* `--sandbox`, whose help text promises "terminal restrictions", changes neither. 56 tools
  before, 56 after, `permission_mode: always-proceed` in both.
* `--mode plan`, which reads like the counterpart to opencode's read-only `plan` persona,
  changes neither either. `write_to_file`, `replace_file_content`, `multi_replace_file_content`,
  `sed_file`, `notebook_edit`, `delete_knowledge` and `run_command` are all live under it.
* Dropping `--dangerously-skip-permissions` DOES change the mode, to `request-review` — and
  that mode refuses every tool. A write test left no file behind, which sounds like the
  answer until the same run refuses a plain READ of a source file and returns an empty
  response. A second_agent that cannot read is not a second_agent.
* There is no config directory to write a policy into. agy keeps `bin/` under the user's
  home and nothing else; no JSON, no TOML, no per-project layer.

So `permissions_enforced` is 0 and `permissions_declared` is 0 as well — unlike codex,
there is not even a flag being sent hopefully. What stands in for a boundary is
`core/agy_guard.py`, which diffs the working tree around every call and names what
changed. That detects a write after it has happened. It does not prevent one, it cannot
see through `.gitignore`, and outside a git repository it reports itself blind.

Point an agy second_agent at a repository only if a process with full read AND write
access to it is acceptable. Where that is not acceptable, opencode is the provider whose
read boundary is actually enforced.
