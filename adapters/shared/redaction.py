"""Redaction accounting shared by every adapter.

An adapter redacts before the executor ever sees the result, which means the executor's
own sanitiser finds nothing left to clean and reports zero hits. Whoever redacted first
is therefore the only party that can still say how much was redacted — and if it drops
that number on the floor, `UsageRecord.redactions` reads 0 for a call that scrubbed a
private key.

That is not hypothetical. opencode carried the accounting; codex and agy carried a copy
of the same function with `clean, _ = redact_value(...)` and threw the hits away, so two
of three providers wrote an audit trail that understated secret exposure as exactly
nothing. The shapes matched, the behaviour did not, and nothing compared them.

So the accounting lives here once. `adapters/base.py` is a Protocol on purpose — it
records the shape an adapter answers to without demanding inheritance — and concrete
helpers do not belong in it. A fourth provider gets this right by importing it, not by
its author remembering the failure mode above.

Redaction itself is unchanged: `utils.redact` decides WHAT is a secret. This module only
decides that the count survives the trip.
