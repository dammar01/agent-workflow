"""Codex CLI as a second_agent provider.

Shaped by four facts about `codex exec` that make it a different animal from opencode,
not a rename of it:

1. The prompt goes in on STDIN (`codex exec -`), never as an argument. OpenCode's adapter
   has to measure its own argv against the Windows 8191-char command-line cap and can
   fail a call before the provider ever runs; here that limit is simply unreachable, so
   there is no `prompt_too_long` path to write.
2. The session id arrives in the FIRST event of the stream —
   `{"type":"thread.started","thread_id":"<uuid>"}` — so there is no bootstrap call to
   pay for. OpenCode needs `init_session` because its id only appears once a session has
   been opened; codex hands it over as the run begins. The id is reported through
   `on_session_created` the moment it is seen rather than after the run, so a call that
   dies mid-way still leaves a resumable session behind.
3. Continuing work is a different subcommand, not a flag: `codex exec resume <id> -`.
   It accepts a NARROWER option set than `exec`: no `-C/--cd`, no `--sandbox`, and no
   `--color`. Those are parser-level refusals — the call dies with `unexpected argument`
   before codex runs, which is why passing one is a total outage of continuation rather
   than a degraded call. The process cwd is what actually roots a call — `_popen_capture`
   spawns with `cwd=` set either way — so the missing `-C` costs a resumed call nothing.
   Sandbox and the declared read boundary both re-assert through `-c`, which resume DOES
   accept, so a resumed call cannot end up looser than the call that opened it.
4. Policy is per-invocation, not a config file. Codex reads `~/.codex/config.toml`, but
   every value in it can be overridden with `-c key=value` on the command line, and the
   sandbox has its own `-s` flag. So this provider ships no global config to merge: the
   read-only boundary rides on every single call and there is no file for a user to drift
   out from under it. `config/providers.py` records that choice.

   That boundary covers writes and NOT reads, which is the opposite of what this paragraph
   used to say. `--sandbox read-only` stops writes; codex's own `--help` scopes it to
   "model-generated shell commands". Reads were supposed to be stopped by
   `[permissions.<profile>.filesystem]`, passed on every call from `core/secret_patterns.py`
   — the same secret list opencode denies, in codex's dialect. It parses, and it stops
   nothing: probed against codex-cli 0.147.0, denying `**` and `**/*` for `:workspace_roots`
   and then asking `codex exec` for a file in that root returns the file at exit 0. Codex
   reads by spawning a shell, and no shell read is routed through the permission map.

   The flags still ship. They cost four argv elements, they are already correct for the day
   codex gates shell reads, and codex has no project-scoped config layer to install them
   into anyway (a `.codex/config.toml` in a project root is not loaded at all), so argv is
   not merely the tidier route here, it is the only one. What must not happen again is
   anyone reading their presence as protection: `adapters/codex_install.py` reports
   `not_enforceable` with `permissions_enforced: 0`, and `dist/config/codex/AGENTS.md` tells
   the agent that avoiding secret files is its own obligation. A codex second_agent can read
   every file in the project it is pointed at.

`--output-schema` is deliberately unused. It would force the final message into JSON, and
the workflow's contract is the text blocks `[EVIDENCE]`/`[DIGEST]` — schema-forcing here
would break the very output the runtime parses.
