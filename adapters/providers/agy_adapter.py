"""agy CLI as a second_agent provider.

Five facts about `agy` decided the shape of this file. Each was probed against the
installed binary rather than read off `--help`, because two of them contradict what the
flag names suggest.

1. The prompt is an ARGUMENT (`-p`), not stdin. That puts agy on the same side as
   opencode and against codex: the command line has a length ceiling this adapter has to
   measure before it spawns, or the failure arrives from the OS as an unreadable error
   with the prompt nowhere in it.

2. The session id arrives in the FIRST line of `--output-format stream-json`:
   `{"event":"init","conversation_id":"<uuid>",...}` on stdout. So there is no bootstrap
   call to pay for and no log file to tail. The `--log-file` route works too — the file
   carries `Created conversation <uuid>` from agy's own server log — but it arrives later,
   needs a temp file, and is a plain-text format with no promise behind it. The pattern
   for it is kept as a fallback, unused on the happy path.

3. Continuing is a FLAG, not a subcommand: `--conversation <id>`. Unlike codex, whose
   `exec resume` accepts a narrower option set, agy takes the same flags either way. The
   two branches here differ by exactly one argument.

4. `--print-timeout` defaults to five minutes. The runtime's own budget defaults to
   thirty. Left alone, agy dies at minute five and the runtime waits out the other
   twenty-five for a process that is already gone, then reports a timeout against the
   wrong cause. So the flag is derived from the effective timeout on every call.

5. There is no read-only mode. This is the fact that matters most and the one the flag
   names hide. `--sandbox` and `--mode plan` were both probed: 56 tools before, 56 tools
   after, `permission_mode: always-proceed` in both, with `write_to_file`,
   `replace_file_content`, `sed_file`, `notebook_edit`, `delete_knowledge` and
   `run_command` present throughout. Dropping `--dangerously-skip-permissions` yields
   `permission_mode: request-review`, which refuses every tool — a write test left no
   file behind, and a plain READ of a source file failed the same way, returning an empty
   response. agy keeps no config directory to install a policy into.

   The choice is therefore binary: every tool including writes, or no tools at all and a
   provider that cannot gather evidence. This adapter takes the first and pairs it with
   `core/agy_guard.py`, which compares the working tree before and after each call. That
   is detection, not prevention. An agy second_agent CAN write to the project it is
   pointed at, and the only thing asking it not to is the prompt.

`--disable-slash-commands` rides every call. agy expands slash commands and skills in
print mode, and the workflow's own prompts are full of `/.explore`-shaped text that must
reach the model as characters rather than as an instruction to agy's CLI.
